# Project of CS548: Network analysis and Side Channel Leaks

## Software implementation
- Use PyShark to do some network analysis
- Input of the entire tool:
  - URL of the website 
  - The input should also contain the IP addresses of:
    - The victim/target
    - The web app the victim is using
  - URL that are used by the web app to fetch data as the user does some input (the URL used to fetch data with AJAX calls) + maybe a cookie or at least of information needed to be able to do the call(different from one API to another)
    - And also all the information needed to generate all the possible calls: (type of payload we need to generate, limit length and so on...)
    - That way we would be able to generate all kind of paylaod and add them to the URL to do some API calls and get the sizes associated with the user input
  - Build a tree containing all the possible input and the corresponding packet size
  - Using the tree built in the previous step, detect the user input that is the most likely to have had happen

## Ideas

- It can be interesting to speak about the SC leaks discovered in the eventLoop of chrome
  - Coupled with network analysis, this could be very efficient and could guarantee a malicious user/attacker to be almost sure on what the victim is actually doing on his computer

## KAYAK API

-  Field Departure : `/mv/marvel?f=h&where=cac&s=58&lc_cc=KR&lc=ko&v=v2&cv=4`
- Field Destination: `/mv/marvel?f=h&where=gmp&s=58&lc_cc=KR&lc=ko&v=v2&cv=4`

They both look the same, so we can see that the payload is after the "where" in the URI.

The paylaod we are going to use to carry out our attack is in the form:
`/mv/marvel?f=h&where=[GENERATED]&s=58&lc_cc=KR&lc=ko&v=v2&cv=4`, where [GENERATED] is a string potentially entered by the user. Note that we observed that no destination name was more that 15 characters. So we can limit the length of the generated string to 15. (Note: For efficiency measures, we can try to find until how many characters we can uniquely identify every destination/depearture, in order to generate a minimum number of payloads, and fasten the search by limiting the number of time we will do calls on the API which will result in a smaller tree)

## Remarks

- Interesting HTTP Header in Kayak: `x-timer:S1511876181.710127,VS0,VE0` and `x-cache-hits:1, 2`. If we make the same request multiple times, the values of these headers actually change and this might affect the size of the TLS packet (no determinism maybe)

## How to run our project

1. Generate the attacker DB:
```
sudo ./attackPreComputation.sh [NumberOfNetworkTracesToUseToGenerateTheDB] [AttackerIP] [serverIP] [interface]
```

2. Sniff and analyze the victim network activity:
```
python networkAnalyzer.py [interface] [victimIP] [serverIP]
```

## Architecture of the project

The project is segmented into different parts. Each file has its own utility and represent one task in the network analysis process.

1. `generator.py`: Module used to generate payloads to build the DB
2. `apiCaller.py`: Module dedicated to do HTTPS requests for all payloads generated by the generator. he goal here is to test all possible actions of the user and record them in a DB.
  - The output of this module is a file (`timingX.json`, where X is the number of the trace) containing where all payloads are associated with the request time/response time and size of content length. These timestamps are used later on to map the network traffic with the specific request/response.
3. `traceBuilderWorker.sh`: Bash script that records the network trace of a session where we tested all the payloads. The output of this "module" is a network traffic file (`analysisX.pcap`, where is the number of the trace). In order to generate the network traffic trace, this script launches `tcpdump` and calls `apiCaller.py`.
4. `traceBuilderManager.sh`: Bash script which launches the desired number of `traceBuilderWorkers` in order to generate numerous network traces. The idea here is to record many network traces in order to diminish the impact of the network noise on our dataset.
5. `traceAnalyzer.py`: Module which analyses the network trace of the corresponding `traceBuilderWorkers` and maps the payloads to their traffic, in order to get the number of bytes sent over the network that correspond to each payload.
6. `dbBuilder.py`: Module that launches as many `traceAnalyzer.py` as we have network traces to analyze into threads. We use parallel computing here in order to speed up the trace analysis. After collecting the results of the `traceAnalyzers`, the `dbBuilder` reads them all and does a `mean` of all the traffic associated to a payload over all traces. This steps aims to reduce the noise of the network and helps having better accurancy. [TODO:] Find a better notion than the mean to join all values from the different traces. The mean is too sensitive to changes and biaised values
7. `attackPreComputation.sh`: Bash module that combines all previous modules in order to build and precompute the DB of the attacker
7. `networkAnalyzer.py`: Module used to sniff the victim network and infer his inputs based on the precomputed database
